## Overview




  

### The challenge

  

Users should be able to:

  

- Receive an error message when the \`form\` is submitted if:

  - Any field is empty

  - The email address is not formatted correctly

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

-   \*\*Bonus\*\*: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)

-   \*\*Bonus\*\*: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

  

### It's my Original Code.

1) I have written all the code myself. Where I have taken help from, I have mentioned that in acknowledgements.
2) There is a youtube by the name Coder Coder. She has coded things in a much more organised way. I will surely love to follow her strategy.
3) If I had followed her strategy, my project would be much much cleaner and well laid out. 
4) By putting my original code, I hope I will get the right feedback to correct my mistakes and shortcomings.

### Built with

  

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox

- CSS Grid

- Mobile-first workflow


###  Things I got right:

1) To be very honest, this project was a manual brute-force strategy. 
2) It was a lot of trial and error. But my previous experience with flebox and grid surely made things a bit easier.
3) I am happy that I was able to tweak mdn code and put the yellow color border-bottom on empty inputs. I tried a bit of DOM manipulation. 
4) I can now appreciate the value of writing clean code.
5) I have got a lot of things right but I feel like there are more things I messed up.
6) I solved horizontal scrolling problem.
7) I chose to not copy other people's solution and go the hard way so that I get the right feedback according to the level that  I'm currently at.
8) I prefered to see more problems in my code because there really are lots of problems. I also see how joyful writing CSS can get once I don't have to guess the behavior of CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox, Positioning, Margins and Paddings.
9) I have come to truly feel the need for writing reusable code. I have seen people do it on youtube but if I can apply that in my development process it will make my development speed much faster.
10) I have developed a lot of interest in planning and having a strategy. I did not feel these things were important. But now I do.

###  Problems I could not fix: 


1) **Disorganised CSS**:The whole process of building this website was filled with lots and lots of problems. And the end-result might look somewhat okay but there are many problems which could have been overcome if I had a better plan to tackle them early on.
2) **Problems caused by focusing on section too much**: When I first started out building this project, the grid that lays out the hero-section was behaving very weird. I was so caught up in solving these hero-section grid problems that I did not plan the css-variables well from the figma file. This might have led to problems in typography. And this might have caused the "Adam Keyes two appear in two lines instead of one(as given in the figma file)."
3) **Unpredictable layout problems**:My layout had so many problems due to which I had to manually set margins and paddings for different media queries. This was so hard that it sucked my joy out of the process. I think I need different classes like section and container to align things properly. I definitely need help on that. This somewhat got okay when I applied justify-content:space-between in the skills section. But it was just out of trial and error. Layout felt very mysterious and very difficult.
4) **Too much repetitve code** :I never used the DRY principle. I have repeated myself over and over again. It was all brute-force. It could have been much more elegant and smooth. I need help on that also. I need to learn how to write reusable classes. For example : the green underline should come from .underline styles defined in style.css only at one place.
5) **Changing styles manually caused lots of problems in other sections**:By the time I felt like I might eventually mess the whole layout, I impatiently wrote the css for skills section and projects section. This led to more trouble cause there was lots of unorganised code in my style.css. Because I know Kevin Powell's youtube channel, and I have seen him organise things in a very clean manner I thought it's a good idea to do things the brute force way and submit it on Frontend Mentor and then get feedback on my mistakes. I am aware of some of the mistakes and I know there are many more that I am not aware of.
6) **Form validation**: The Contact Form's Javascript is little bit taken from MDN and somewhat customized to meet the project requirements. But there must be a better way to handle errors. **I still was not able to get the warning icon in the input box**. **Also, the email validation does not work as expected**. Tweaking the MDN code in my app.js did not follow clean code standards. It could have been much elegant.
7) The Contact Form's grid layout was messed up because I had disorganised padding and margin(I am just guessing).
8) **Over using !important**: This happend all the time. It somehow worked while I was doing media queries. But I think so much !important is not necessary.
9) In many places I felt like I am rushing to make a submit on Frontend Mentor. This might have caused lots of wrong decisions while writing CSS.
10) **overlay effect** : The links that appear on hovering over the project image are very light. I guess I did not understand how opacity works. I took a little bit help from w3schools.com but that did not help me much.
11) **Problematic typography font-sizes**: I did not touch the font-sizes much because everytime I changed a font at one place, my layout was breaking and getting messed up.
12) **Different classes for displaying different size hero-image**: I had to write four different media queries for showing and hiding hero images. I could have used srcset just like Jessica Chan from Coder Coder did.
13) **Inconsistent border bottom in form validation**: I had already spent 1 hour on form validation and setting border-bottom color on empty-field, valid and invalid inputs. Something was not working right so I had to revert back to this current version. Like I said, form validation could have been way more better.  I really need a standard set of steps to implement form validation in a much more predictable way.
14) **Problems I might have missed**: I am a beginner. I might have missed lots of problems. I would love to hear about them and how they can be fixed. After deploying on netlify, there might still be some layout issues.

### Lessons I learnt:

1) I want to have a layout plan for every section. This layout plan will be responsive. For example, whenever I see a hero-section, I should be able to arrange that layout using Grid layout or Flexbox Layout or both. I don't want to keep guessing how Grid or Flexbox will behave. Guessing like this and tweaking CSS makes this whole process feel like a nightmare.
2) I want to make form validation much more predictable and professional.
3) To take time and set custom css properties and have my CSS code organised and well-commented.
4) To follow the figma file provided much more rigorously.
